**Project:**
 Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization & Efficient Frontier in Excel

**Tools Used:**
Microsoft Excel, Solver, Data Analysis ToolPak, Monte Carlo Simulation

# Project Overview:
Constructed an optimal investment portfolio from multiple financial assets (Equities, Bonds and Gold) using Excel. The objective was to identify the most efficient portfolio that maximizes return for a given level of risk, or minimizes risk for a given level of return, by analyzing asset correlations and risk metrics through a **covariance matrix** and **random simulations.**

# Key Methodologies and Steps:

# 1. Data Collection & Processing:
- Gathered historical price data for a selection of diversified assets (e.g., equities, gold, bonds).
- Calculated daily/weekly returns and normalized the dataset for analysis.

# 2. Covariance Matrix Calculation:
- Computed the covariance matrix to capture the interdependencies and co-movements between asset returns.
-Used this matrix to assess portfolio variance and standard deviation (overall portfolio risk).

# 3. Random Portfolio Simulations (Monte Carlo Simulation):
- Generated thousands of random portfolios with varying asset weight combinations.
- Calculated expected return, risk (standard deviation), and **Sharpe Ratio** for each simulated portfolio.
- Used scatter plots to visualize the **efficient frontier**, showing the optimal risk-return combinations.

# 4. Efficient Frontier Visualization:
- Mapped all portfolios on a return vs. risk chart to highlight the shape of the efficient frontier.
- Highlighted the **Minimum Variance Portfolio** and **Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio**.

# 5. Optimization using Solver:
- Applied Excel Solver to calculate the asset weights that result in:
    - (a) **Maximum Sharpe Ratio** (best risk-adjusted return)
    - (b) **Minimum Portfolio Variance**
    - (c) **Target Return or Target Risk Constraints**

 - Incorporated constraints such as full investment (weights sum to 100%) and no short selling (weights â‰¥ 0).

# 6. Insights & Interpretation:
- Analyzed how diversification reduces portfolio risk.
- Interpreted the shape and slope of the efficient frontier and how asset correlations affect overall risk.
- Provided actionable investment recommendations based on risk tolerance and return expectations.

# Outcome:
- Successfully built a **dynamic Excel model** for portfolio optimization.
- Gained deeper insights into **risk-adjusted performance**, diversification benefits, and efficient capital allocation.
- Created a **visual and interactive tool** for investors and analysts to explore optimal portfolios based on market data.

This project strengthened my understanding of financial modeling, risk analysis, and portfolio management principles using Excel-based tools without the need for advanced programming.
